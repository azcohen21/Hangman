\f0\fs24 \cf0 #Alex\'92s Hangman Project\
##The purpose of the program is to emulate the hangman game.\
The user is given 10 lives.\
When the user has 0 lives left, the game is over and you die.\
The user is to choose a letter to see if that letter is in the hidden codeword.\
This codeword - upon successful guessing of the correct letters will be decoded to reveal the actual word. \
\
The letters you guess will be stored in a bank where you can see them and make sure you don\'92t repeat them.\
If you do repeat a letter, the program will tell you that you have already guessed that letter and will allow you to guess another letter with no deduction in the number of lives you have remaining. \
\
If the letter is a correct part of the codeword, the program will confirm the letter is in the word and you will see the correct letter now revealed.\
\
If the letter in an incorrect choice and not part of the codeword, the program will confirm the letter is not in the word and you will lose a life.\
\
If you try to enter more than one letter at a time the program will not process your action further and cancel your request; only one letter can be entered at a time.\
\
\
If you run out of lives (lives = 0) you will die.}
